# emojipacks-local (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)

> CLI to bulk upload emojis to your Slack! Pimped to accept local files/directories instead of YAML

Forked from [lambtron's emojipack](https://github.com/lambtron/emojipacks)

## Install

*Note you must have `node` and `npm` installed. If you don't, go to [nodejs.org](https://www.nodejs.org) and follow the install instructions there.*

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/thbaumbach/emojipacks-local.git
$ cd emojipacks-local
$ make
```

## Usage

There is only one command:

```bash
$ emojipacks-local
```

It'll ask you a few questions:

```bash
Slack subdomain: 20percentclub
Email address login: andyjiang@gmail.com
Password: *********
Path or URL of Emoji yaml file: ./packs/futurama.yaml
```

Then, let it work its magic:

```bash
Starting import

Uploaded emojis
```

## Optionally Pass Command Line Parameters

This will allow for easier batch uploading of multiple yaml files

```bash
$ emojipacks-local -s <subdomain> -e <email> -p <password> -y <yaml_file>
```

## Troubleshooting

This script will essentially log into your Slack and then submit a `POST` request on the emoji upload form page. If you are seeing errors, make sure that:
- **you have Slack privileges to add custom emojis**: otherwise, the script won't be able to get to the emoji upload form
- **you disabled two-factor authentication**: again, having two-factor enabled will prevent the script from getting to the necessary emoji upload form
- **your credentials are correct**: if you have done all of the following correctly try running the command **emojipacks-local -d**
